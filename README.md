# UT Dining App
A UT dining web app that simplifies the filtering of food items.

### Server
To setup the server, go to ```config/server.json``` and configure the server properties.

Once the server properties have been setup, start the server by running:
```console
cd server
python3 server.py
```

To initiate the client, copy and paste the files inside the ```client``` folder into your web-server's public HTMl folder.
